#Object tests

This repo contain test cases for data types and data structurs with reference to person class along with correct and worng implmentation.

##String equals test cases

    Purpose : To understand difference between strings created as literals and created as constructor.

It has test cases on equals of strings created as literals and those created with constructor of String class. 

This also compares the references of Strings. For string literals the references are same but for strings created with constructor the references are different.

##Test cases for Person class

    Purpose : To understand behaviour of different data structurs with worng implementation.

Person has name and age. It has tested the Person's equals method for correct and wrong implementation of equals. It has been tested with different data structures like hash table,sets and array list

##Comparators of Person

    Purpose : To understand implementation of comparator, compareTo method and interface.
    
This implements comparators over Person class for comparing name,name length,age,reverse name using comparator.

##Test cases for ArrayList
    Purpose : To understand how ArrayList works and throw exceptions and how                 to test that in test case.
    
It tests ArrayList with different generics.object-tools
